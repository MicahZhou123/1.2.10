1. made a program that replaces the placeholders using .replace
2. scrapped that idea and decided to use indexOf and substring
3. used indexof to locate where each placeholder starts
4. I then split the template sentence to where I can replace the placeholders using .length


1. The program asks for:
A name
An adjective
A noun
A verb ending in -ing
A place
2. It replaces placeholders in a story template with your answers
3. It prints the completed story at the end
4. can be done for ANY sentence, as long as you have proper placeholders



EXAMPLE: 

Enter name: Micah
Enter an adjective: sleepy
Enter a noun: skateboard
Enter a verb ending in -ing: cruising
Enter a place: Shanghai

Micah was feeling very adventurous one day so they grabbed their favorite skateboard and started cruising. Eventually, they ended up in Shanghai!
